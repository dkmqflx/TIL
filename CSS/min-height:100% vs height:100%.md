The difference between min-height: 100% and height: 100% lies in how they affect the sizing of an element relative to its parent container:

### min-height: 100%:

- This property ensures that the element's height is at least 100% of the height of its containing block.
  `
- If the content within the element requires more space, the element will expand beyond 100% to accommodate it.

- However, if the content is smaller than the height of the container, the element will only take up as much space as needed by the content, but never less than 100% of the container's height.

### height: 100%:

- This property sets the height of the element to be exactly 100% of the height of its containing block.

- Unlike min-height, this property does not allow the element to expand beyond 100% of its container's height, even if the content within the element requires more space.

- If the content exceeds the specified height, it may overflow and be hidden or cause scrollbars to appear, depending on the overflow property of the container.

- In summary,` min-height: 100%` ensures that the element is at least as tall as its containing block, while `height: 100% `sets the element's height to be exactly the same as its containing block, potentially causing overflow if the content exceeds this height.
