- In React, when the style of a DOM element that a component is referencing (via a ref) changes, the component typically re-renders. This behavior is due to React's reconciliation process.

### 1. **Virtual DOM Reconciliation**

- React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance.

- When a component's state or props change, React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one to identify what actually changed.

### 2. **Ref and DOM Manipulation**

- When you use a ref to access a DOM element within a React component, you're essentially bypassing React's virtual DOM and directly manipulating the DOM.

- Changes made to the DOM outside of React's control, such as modifying styles via a ref, aren't automatically recognized by React.

### 3. **Re-render Trigger**

- However, React needs to ensure that the virtual DOM accurately reflects the actual DOM.

- So, when it detects that a ref has been used to change the style of a DOM element, React assumes that the component may have been affected by this change.

- Therefore, it re-renders the component to reflect any potential updates caused by the style change.

- Thus,

```jsx
// re-render
contentsRef.current.style.height = `${contentsRef.current.scrollHeight}px`;

// does not re-render
contentsRef.current = 1;
```

### 4. **Efficient Rendering**

- React is smart about rendering and will typically batch and optimize updates for performance.

- So, while a style change to a DOM element may trigger a re-render, React will try to optimize this process to minimize unnecessary renders and maximize performance.

- In summary, when you change the style of a DOM element using a ref in a React component, React may trigger a re-render of the component to ensure that its virtual DOM accurately reflects the actual DOM.
