  > BEM encourages you to use modifiers to handle component variations. This may seem smart at first, yet unfortunately leads up to other problems: you end up creating tons of modifiers you only use once for a specific use-case. Worse: from one component to another, you might end up with similar modifiers, further breaking the DRY principle.
